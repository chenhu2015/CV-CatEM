Emotion recognition has been well studied for human, but not for animals. In this project, a study on emotion recognition is presented for cats. Facial expression, which is the most crucial part of detecting cat emotion, is classified with a pipeline where cat face detection, facial feature extraction, mouth open/close detection is included. Also, an AI dubbing for soundless videos of cats is created in which we can tell when cats would miaow from their mouth movement. In advance, we can tell what type of sounds those cats would generate by recognizing cats’ facial expression and relating those to cats’ emotions. The project is implemented with TensorFlow.
